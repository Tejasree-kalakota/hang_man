 Just Completed My First Mini Python Game â€“ Hangman!

This project helped me reinforce several important programming concepts like:

->Loops and conditionals

->String manipulation

->User input handling

->List operations

Simple ASCII art animations using Python lists
What I learned:
âœ… How to break down a problem step-by-step
âœ… Using logic to match user input with the correct output
âœ… How to manage game state like lives and win/loss conditions
âœ… Displaying output creatively using ASCII visuals

It may look simple, but building even small projects like this is a great way to strengthen the core of programming. I'm enjoying every bit of this journey!
Grateful for the progress, and excited for the next project.
